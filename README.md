## Risk Global Domination RL Decision Aid
This repository houses a project aiming to provide assistance in making strategic decisions while playing Risk Global Domination, using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. Our solution involves creating a web-based interface to interact with the trained RL model that suggests the next optimal move based on the current game state.

## Project Components
* Risk Global Domination Environment: A game environment compatible with the RL framework. It captures the game rules, states, rewards, and actions.
* Reinforcement Learning Model: An RL model that learns optimal strategies by interacting with the game environment.
* Web Interface: A user-friendly website where users can input the current state of the game and receive the recommended next move from our trained RL model.

## Key Steps
1. Understanding the Game: Familiarize ourselves with the rules and strategies of Risk Global Domination to define a suitable reward structure for the RL model.

2. Creating the Risk Environment: Develop a Risk Global Domination environment compatible with the RL framework of choice.

3. Training the RL Model: Utilize an RL model, e.g., DQN, PPO, or A3C, to interact with the game environment and learn the best strategies.

4. Testing and Validating the Model: Assess the performance of the trained RL model in playing the game to ensure it has learned effective strategies.

5. Developing the Web Interface: Design and implement a website that represents the game state and interacts with the RL model.

6. Model-Website Integration: Use a backend server to run the model and communicate with the website. The server takes game state from the website, inputs it into the RL model, and returns the next optimal move.

7. Testing and Deployment: Test the complete system to ensure accurate and efficient functioning. After successful testing, deploy the website for public use.

This project is an experiment in applying Reinforcement Learning to strategy board games and is designed to be a fun and interactive aid for Risk Global Domination players.
